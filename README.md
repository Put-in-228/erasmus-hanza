## Project task

During **ERASMUS+ BIP** project our task was to create Power BI report templates to show _Hanza_ company's data on TV screens<sup>Power BI report files can be found in [Power BI reports](/Power%20BI%20reports) folder</sup>. 

Secondary objective was to create a web application which visualizes the data as well as has Graphical User Interface elements to navigate through different reports<sup>web application can be found in [hanza-web-app](/hanza-web-app) folder</sup>.

## Power BI reports
Power BI report templates were made using 8 main indicators:
- ***OEE%***
- ***Productivity***
- ***Late hours***
- ***Hours***
- ***Rejection costs***
- ***Safety***
- ***Maitenance***
- ***Undefined interruptions***
