During **ERASMUS+ BIP** project our task was to create Power BI report templates to show _Hanza_ company's data on TV screens<sup>Power BI report files can be found in [Power BI reports](/erasmus-hanza/Power%20BI%20reports) folder</sup>. 

Secondary objective was to create a web application which visualizes the data as well as has Graphical User Interface elements to navigate through different reports<sup>web application can be found in [hanza-web-app](/erasmus-hanza/hanza-web-app) folder</sup>.

## Power BI reports
Power BI report templates were made using 8 main indicators:
- ***OEE%***
- ***Productivity***
- ***Late hours***
- ***Hours***
- ***Rejection costs***
- ***Safety***
- ***Maitenance***
- ***Undefined interruptions***

## Web application as data visualization solution
To visualize data on TV screens we chose to create web application with embedded Power BI reports. Examples on how it looks like can be seen below.
